One-dimensional Cellular Automaton written in Rust.

---
## Cellular Automata in a Nutshell

> _A pixelated universe where simple local rules orchestrate worlds of astonishing complexity._

Cellular automata are mathematical models composed of grids of cells, 
each existing in one of several possible states. 
The state of each cell changes over time according to predefined rules, 
typically influenced by the states of neighboring cells. 
These models, simple in design yet capable of demonstrating complex behaviors, 
are utilized in various fields to simulate and explore dynamic systems, 
from biological patterns to computational processes and physical phenomena. 
They offer a fascinating glimpse into how complex structures and behaviors can emerge from simple, 
local interactions.

There are an astronomical number of resources on cellular automata on the web.
But for a simple and clear presentation of cellular automata, 
read chapter 7 of [Daniel Shiffman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Shiffman)'s 
[The Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-7-cellular-automata/).

## Why a 1D Cellular Automaton nowadays? :thinking:

### For the Fun of It
One-dimensional cellular automata (1D CA) are just cool to play with.
They're visually engaging and offer an intuitive way to get your head around some pretty complex ideas.
Watching these patterns evolve over time is not only fascinating but can also be super fun.
It's a great way to make learning about automata theory a bit more exciting.

### Simplicity and Dynamics Understanding
Compared to their multi-dimensional cousins, 1D CAs are way easier to grasp and visualize.
But don't let their simplicity fool you â€“ they can model some pretty intricate behaviors.
Even with simple rules, 1D CAs can show emergent behaviors and interesting patterns, 
giving us a peek into how simple rules can lead to complex dynamics. 
This makes them perfect for teaching and understanding the chaos theory, 
dynamical systems theory, and computational properties.

### Learning Rust Programming
Approaching one-dimensional cellular automata is for me a way to challenge myself with Rust.
It's less about delving into the specific details of the language and more about using this 
project as a field of exploration to get a handle on Rust. By working on creating a 1D CA, 
I'm giving myself the opportunity to practically test Rust, 
to understand how it works and how it can be used to materialize such an interesting concept. 
It's more of a learning journey and discovery with the language through a project that interests me.
