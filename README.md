One-dimensional Cellular Automaton written in Rust.

## Cellular Automata in a Nutshell

> A pixelated universe where simple local rules orchestrate worlds of astonishing complexity.

Cellular automata are mathematical models composed of grids of cells, 
each existing in one of several possible states. 
The state of each cell changes over time according to predefined rules, 
typically influenced by the states of neighboring cells. 
These models, simple in design yet capable of demonstrating complex behaviors, 
are utilized in various fields to simulate and explore dynamic systems, 
from biological patterns to computational processes and physical phenomena. 
They offer a fascinating glimpse into how complex structures and behaviors can emerge from simple, 
local interactions.

There are an astronomical number of resources on cellular automata on the web.
But for a simple and clear presentation of cellular automata, 
read chapter 7 of [Daniel Shiffman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Shiffman)'s 
[The Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-7-cellular-automata/).
