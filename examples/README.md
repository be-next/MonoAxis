- **example_01**: Sum #1. At the beginning, there are two packets of cells in state 1. The rule is designed to make them move towards each other and merge into one packet.
- **example_02**: Sum #2. At the beginning, there are two packets of cells in state 1. The rule is designed to show a third packet on the right, which is the sum of the first two packets.
- **example_04**: Inverse. The rule is designed to invert two packets of cells in state 1.
- **example_06**: Divide by 2. The rule is designed to divide a packet of cells in state 1 by 2.
- **example_07**: Generator n+1. The rule is designed to generate a packet of cells in state 1 with a size of n+1.
- **rule_184**: Rule 184 is a one-dimensional binary cellular automaton rule,
  notable for solving the majority problem as well as for its ability to simultaneously describe several,
  seemingly quite different, particle systems: traffic flow, particle deposition, and so on.
